# Part 3 - Multivariable Linear Regression Writeup

After completing `a6_part3.py` answer the following questions

## Questions to answer

1. What is the R Squared coefficient for your model? What does that mean about the model in relation to your data?
0.86
2. Is your model accurate? Why or why not?
Yes because in general
3. What does the model predict a 10-year-old car with 89000 miles is worth? What about a car that is 20 years old with 150000 miles?
$9621
$657
4. You may notice that some of your predicted results are negative. This is occurring when the value of age and the mileage of the car are very high. Why do you think this is happening?
This is because the prediciton is a linear line yet in reality it is more of an exponetial function as the value of the car descends, and the predicted line is under the x-axis of the graph yet in reality the car still has a price.
