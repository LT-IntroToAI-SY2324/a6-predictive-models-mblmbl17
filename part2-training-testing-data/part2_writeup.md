# Part 2 - Training and Testing Data Writeup

After completing `a6_part2.py` answer the following questions

## Questions to answer

1. What makes this model more effective than the model you created in the previous lesson?
This is more effective because it uses data from an outside database without needing to copy and past the data into a new folder. Also it works through alot of more data and therefore it has a more accurate caclulation of the r squared coeficient.

2. What does the R squared coefficient tell you about the model?
It tells us that it is not very accurate at predicting and the data does not have a strong trend. 

3. Would you say that your model is accurate? What evidence supports your conclusion? Consider the meaning of the predicted and actual values in the context of the chart below from the American Heart Associationâ€™s website on understanding blood pressure.
It is not very accurate, while it can give a general guess the results vary wildly and it is not very good at giving a realistic answer.
