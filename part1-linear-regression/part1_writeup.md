# Part 1 - Linear Regression Writeup

After completing `a6_part1.py` answer the following questions

## Questions to answer

1. What is the r squared value?  What does this say about this lenear regression model?
o.6257 this means that the line isn't very linear and any prediction on the line of best fit could be very different as there is not a strong correlation to the line of best fit.
2. According to your model, what is the predicted systolic blood pressure for a person iwho is 43 years old?
137.46
3. How accurate do you think this model's predictions are?  Do you think this model is accurate enough to reliably predict someone's blood pressure based on their age?  Why or why not?  And if not, what could improve the model?
not very accurate because the r squared is way too low, to dial this in and make the model more accurate, many more data points should be used.
